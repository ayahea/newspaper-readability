# Newspaper Readability
This is the semester project by Ayah Aboelela and Gregory Minckler for MATH 345: Probability and Statistics taught by Professor David Degras at UMass Boston, Spring 2019. 

Here, we aim to assess the reasability of different newspaper entires, comparing and contrasting between different publications. We noted the length of words and of sentences in each article and took their means among articles of different newspapers and among the two genres: news and editorials. With both word and sentence length we also took the variances and contrasted the results similarly over certain collections. We took note of words that appeared in articles and not in others to find any related potential generalizations (contrast findings). We found any correlations that became obvious about the links between these findings. For a more general and meaningful overview of the complexity of the language used, we used an already-developed algorithm associated with the famous Flesch Readability Scale on all of the articles and contrasted our findings with what is known about everyday speech.
